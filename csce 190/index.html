        <h2>Problem statement: Student parking</h2>
        <p>
          Students have trouble finding unoccupied parking spaces and don't 
          know where to park at certain times of the day without getting into 
          trouble. An app to help display the best times to park and which 
          parking spots are most conventient would be extremely helpful to those 
          that have difficulties.
