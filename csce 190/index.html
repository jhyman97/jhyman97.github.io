				<h2>Problem statement: Student parking</h2>
				<p>
				Students have trouble finding unoccupied parking spaces and don't 
				know where to park at certain times of the day without getting into 
				trouble. An app to help display the best times to park and which 
				parking spots are most conventient would be extremely helpful to those 
				that have difficulties.

				<p>
					There are many ways to implement this app, and it all starts with planning. From app architecture 
					to user interaction/experience, our affinty diagram takes into account everything in order to create 
					something cohesive and applicable to helping someone who needs assistance in getting around USC's terrible 
					existing parking system.

					This is a story board about my persona, Jeffrey. It describes a scenario where he arrives to campus, very confused on 
					where to park. He consults the USC parking app in order to find a close enough spot so that he isn't late to classes.
