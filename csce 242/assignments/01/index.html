        <h1>A List of My Favorite Fast Food Restraunts</h1>
        <p>Being a student in college, sometimes it's hard having to find the energy to do a lot of things.
            From classes to homework, the first thing you'll always want to do is lay down and relax.
            Sadly, a lot of the time you'll find yourself hungry, so naturally you might go into the fridge
            and try to scavenge whatever food you can get. But even then, sometimes there's nothing you feel 
            like eating in the fridge, what do you do then?</p>
        <p>Well, that's where fast food restraunts come in! While they may not always be the most healthy or 
            cheapest places to eat, they're always really convenient, especially for college students! I used 
            to play golf while growing up and I traveled across the state from place to place, so I've ate at 
            quite a lot of fast food places over the years. So, I've made up a list detailing my top 4 favorite 
            fast food restraunts to eat at! Along with them, you'll find a table of some of my favorite foods to 
            order from each place, as well as a link to the rest of their menu. Are any of yours on here?</p>

            <p>Bojangles has to have some of the best chicken I've ever had, and it goes really well with their
                sweet barbeque sauce! Not only that, but the seasoning on the fries is unmatched. Definitely a 
                well deserved spot on my list!</p>
