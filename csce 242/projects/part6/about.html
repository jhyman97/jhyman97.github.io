                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>
                        ClothingMania was envisioned and made by a group of friends who met each other on one fateful day in high school. Ideas were spread around between each other, and eventually manifested into reality. Since early 2024, we've strived to create and sell high quality products that make our customers happy, for an affordable price!
                        
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Our eventual long term goal is to expand not only the team, but the brand to a point that becomes meaningful to every customer that shares an experience with us. While we might have these ambitious dreams, it all starts from scratch, and there's nowhere to go but up!

                            <p>
                                Jeremiah is the mastermind behind it all, the one who had the original idea of opening an online clothing shop. Without him, this realization wouldn't have been possible. From handling customer service to managing sales, Jeremiah does it all! When off the clock, he typically loves to go golfing with friends or getting gains in the gym.

                                Tyler takes on the more artistic side of the team, as he manages the user experience/interface design of the site. The layout and navigation were all completely made from scratch by him, and he continues to contribute as more updates are added to the site! When not working, Tyler loves to express his creative side by pursuing his interests with drawing.

                                Logan presides over the back-end side of things when it comes to the site, handling the overall security and inventory that we have to offer. He's extremely knowledgable about full-stack development, so without someone like him, we wouldn't even have a site to put up! Logan typically loves to work on personal side projects such as creating games, or other websites!
